## NOTE: Due to the deprecation of SF2D, this project is being put on hold. I'm currently doing a lot of stuff for school and don't want to make promises I can't keep. Follow the project's twitter account (below) for more updates.

## Current Release: [Release 2.2](https://github.com/BtheDestroyer/SpriteTools/releases/tag/2.2)

SpriteTools is an open source 3DS Homebrew library for C/C++. It's being developed to make the development process easier, faster, and more accessible for ourselves and other developers.

If you have any suggestions or requests for future additions, please create an issue!

## "Do I need to install anything before this?"

Make sure devkitPro and devkitARM are installed. Other than that, installing SpriteTools Release 2.2 and later should automatically install ctrulib, citro3d, sf2d, and sfil (It won't overwrite anything you already have installed, though).

## "Why is your style so weird?" "Why do you make your lines so short?" "Why no tabs?!"

We're following the [ANSI C Standard](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C). This means, among other things, that we use 2 spaces instead of tabs which makes sure our code looks the same by having the same width on everyone's computer regardless of OS, text editor, or settings. The 80 character count per line also ensures this and makes sure everyone can use their own setup such as having a vertical monitor for coding.

## "You should add _____" "_____ is broken for me. Why?"

better!
